    <p>"As an IB student at HFS, I never felt overwhelmed by the vastness of the curriculum. From the very first orientation, the school and the teachers made the students embrace the qualities of an IB learner, and facilitated a smooth transition into this new curriculum. There was a balance of rigorous classroom studies and extracurricular experiences. For instance, I was a part of multiple CAS trips that ranged from working with an NGO to teach children in a village in Ambewadi to a cross-cultural interactive session with a school in Vietnam. Moreover, the school facilitated a constant exposure to a diverse array of professional opportunities and ideas with regular talks from professionals from various fields and an internship program which provided insightful hands-on workplace experiences.Although there were several strict deadlines that we	Reavant Singh (IBDP II)
        had to adhere to for our extended essays and subject coursework, I was able to stick to the submission timelines due to the constant support from my subject teachers with discussions and feedback sessions. Overall, I value the collection of experiences I've had at this school which have built a firm foundation for my future endeavours."
